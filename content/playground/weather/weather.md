### Reinventing a classic

As a "warmup" project for the Information Design and Visualization studio course at MIT I took in the Spring of 2023, we created weather apps. We were first tasked with creating a traditional weather app with a personal spin. I chose to create an app that helped you see the weather of your friends and family, relative to your own.

### Making it "abstract"

I wanted to push my design further by making an abstract interpretation of a weather app. I thought this version could be fun as a dynamic iPhone wallpaper.

right="<p>In this version, I mapped different weather variables to rectangles and colors. I created a gradient to represent temperature and filled in white space that mapped to different weather conditions and cloud cover.</p>"
>}}

Ultimately, this was a fun project that pushed me to expand my coding skills in p5.js and understanding of API calls. It also asked that I create my own visual language, a skill I continue to hone.
