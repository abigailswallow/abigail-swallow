## What I'm Consuming

### Reading
Currently reading two books, if you want a more recent update on my reading follow me on [literal.club](https://literal.club/abigail).   

- [Building: A Carpenter's Notes on Life & the Art of Good Work](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2b97b2b9-c617-4858-acdb-95db526ded38) by Mark Ellison. 

### Watching
- Apple TV's **Severance** Season 2. In my opinion one of the best shows of all time, so excited to see where this season takes us.
