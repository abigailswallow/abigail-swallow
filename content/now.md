This is a ["now" page](https://nownownow.com/about) all about things I am currently doing, thinking about or consuming. Updated periodically. 

# What I'm up to "now"

## What I'm Doing

- Finishing up my last year at Harvard and focused on my Independent Design Engineering Project (IDEP), our version of a thesis. 
- Applying to full time positions to (hopefully) start in 2024. I'm seeking roles in multidisciplinary design groups or product management. If you have any leads or ideas about this [please reach out](mailto:abigail.r.swallow@gmail.com). 
- Training for the Boston Half Marathon, it's my first one, tips appreciated. 
- Trying to teach myself proper piano technique and learn some classical songs. 


## What I'm Consuming

### Reading
Currently reading two books, if you want a more recent update on my reading follow me on [literal.club](https://literal.club/abigail). 
1. [Born to Run](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/born-to-run-a-hidden-tribe-superathletes-and-the-greatest-race-the-world-has-never-seen-9780307279187) by Christopher McDougall. This book has been *okay*. I am enjoying the storytelling but could do with a little less preaching about running with no shoes on. 
2. [How Data Happened](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/how-data-happened-a-history-from-the-age-of-reason-to-the-age-of-algorithms-9781324006732) by Chris Wiggins and Matthew L. Jones. Loving this book though it's pretty dense and taking me forever to get through. Fascinating to understand how data and statistics are relatively new things and shaping our society in ways we don't often realize.

### Listening
I've been in a bit of a music rut recently so I'm returning to old favorites like Jack Johnson, Brandi Carlile and Ray LaMontagne.

As always, I'm on a constant rotation of podcasts. These are some I'm loving right now:
1. [Hard Fork](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork) is a funny, engaging and relevant podcast about the world of tech from Kevin Roose and Casey Newton.
2. I listen to [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily) nearly every morning to get up to date on the most important news. 
3. [Empire](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/empire/id1639561921) focuses on the rise and fall of empires often not discussed in history class. This one is fascinating and well tied to modern issues of economics, globalization and trade.
