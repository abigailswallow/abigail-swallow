A little bit about who I am, what I do and why. Visit my [now](https://abigailswallow.com/now/) page for more about what I've been up to to recently.

## The Quick Version

I'm a current Master of Design Engineering student at Harvard University, interested in using multidisciplinary design methods to tackle important problems. Previously, I studied Social Policy at Northwestern University, knowledge I find incredibly relevant to design. Originally, I'm from Seattle, WA but am presently based in Cambridge, MA. In the future, I would like to work in a multidisciplinary, design-centric environment working on issues I care about. 

Please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:abigail.r.swallow@gmail.com).

## The Long Version

### I'm an optimistic problem solver:

right="<p>Whether it's a tricky math problem or a grander societal issue, what motivates me is getting stuck in sticky problems.</p> <p>This love led me first to study Social Policy at Northwestern University where I learned how to adopt a 10,000 foot view to solve problems at a large scale.</p><p>While I loved working on issues I am deeply passionate about, I wanted to work on problems in a more tangible way. This led me to <a src=\"https://mde.harvard.edu\">Harvard's Master of Design Engineering program</a> where I'm currently completing my final year.</p>"
>}}

### I don't like the word generalist, but I am one:

I believe solving important issues will almost always require a multidisciplinary approach. **Learning about famous inventors, thinkers and designers teaches me that the most impactful solutions come from outside disciplinary bounds. Plus, I'm insatiably curious.**

As a result, I've sought to develop skill sets across disciplines with the goal of being a well-rounded thinker, someone that can connect the dots to problem-solve effectively. Tangibly this means I've worked to hone my skills in computer science, computational design and Theory of Change methodologies. Today, I continue following paths I'm curious about and expanding my knowledge so I can continue becoming a more effective designer. Some would say that makes me a generalist. 

### I'm a doer:

Growing up in Seattle, WA instilled in me a love for activity, especially in the beautiful places surrounding the PNW. But I also love exploring urban life, museums and local haunts. For the past 10 years I trained as a competitive fencer and as my college career has wound down, I'm now enjoying the opportunity to connect with long neglected hobbies of mine like playing musical instruments and climbing. 

I try to be action oriented in my work and in my personal life and I'm always open to new opportunities and adventures. If that resonates, [please reach out](mailto:abigail.r.swallow@gmail.com), I'd love to meet you.
