                I'm a current student in Harvard Universityâ€™s Masters of Design Engineering program, with a background
                in
                Social Policy. I am passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to bring about change in a variety
                of
                settings. Though my focus is problem solving at "high altitude" I have developed a skillset
                around computational design, data science and industrial design methods. I am a versatile designer
                excited
                about
                applying my skills to challenging problems.
