      <description>Reinventing a classic As a &amp;ldquo;warmup&amp;rdquo; project for the Information Design and Visualization studio course at MIT I took in the Spring of 2023, we created weather apps. We were first tasked with creating a traditional weather app with a personal spin. I chose to create an app that helped you see the weather of your friends and family, relative to your own.
Making it &amp;ldquo;abstract&amp;rdquo; I wanted to push my design further by making an abstract interpretation of a weather app.</description>

      <description>Who is the G.O.A.T of Women&amp;rsquo;s Saber Fencing?

      <description>The Process Our Vision Create a dynamic data visualization web-app merging music and textiles, transforming Spotify listening history into personalized fabric patterns.
The Challenge synThread is a dynamic data visualization web-app that seamlessly merges the realms of music and textiles. Developed as part of the Master of Design Engineering&amp;rsquo;s first-year studio course, the project was a collaborative effort among a team of three, including myself, Gail Alderson and Sophie Leamon. Our challenge was to craft an innovative data visualization concept centered around textiles, culminating in the creation of a personalized fabric design generated from a user&amp;rsquo;s Spotify listening history.</description>
