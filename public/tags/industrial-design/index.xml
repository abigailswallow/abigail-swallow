      <description>&amp;ldquo;Aging in Grace&amp;rdquo; Inspired by my grandmother Annie, Carbot&amp;rsquo;s aim is to empower aging adults by facilitating medication management and fostering connections with their care team and community. While it&amp;rsquo;s a healthcare device in terms of functionality, at its core it&amp;rsquo;s about providing autonomy and connection to adults seeking to age in place.
What began as a 1-week design sprint with the brief, &amp;ldquo;Identify a need and design a robot to solve that need&amp;rdquo; ended as a personal project.</description>
