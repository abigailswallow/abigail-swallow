      <description>A little bit about who I am, what I do and why. Visit my now page for more about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to to recently.
I&amp;rsquo;m an optimistic problem solver: Working on a chess playing robot with my friend, Allison Karp. Whether it&#39;s a tricky math problem or a grander societal issue, what motivates me is getting stuck in sticky problems.
This love led me first to study Social Policy at Northwestern University where I learned how to adopt a 10,000 foot view to solve problems at a large scale.</description>

      <description>Designing for Inclusion and Sustainability Project Brief A product of my first-year studio course in my Master of Design Engineering program, &amp;ldquo;Horizon&amp;rdquo; was a collaborative effort among a team of three: myself, Kamila Czachorowski and Ghalya Alsanea. The project revolved around the intersection of fashion, textiles, and sustainability, aiming to re-imagine how apparel corporations approach design, particularly for gender non-conforming people.
The central ambition was to catalyze a more inclusive design approach, catering to gender-non-conforming consumers whose voices often remain marginalized in mainstream fashion.</description>

      <description>Reinventing a classic As a &amp;ldquo;warmup&amp;rdquo; project for the Information Design and Visualization studio course at MIT I took in the Spring of 2023, we created weather apps. We were first tasked with creating a traditional weather app with a personal spin. I chose to create an app that helped you see the weather of your friends and family, relative to your own.
Making it &amp;ldquo;abstract&amp;rdquo; I wanted to push my design further by making an abstract interpretation of a weather app.</description>

      <description>Who is the G.O.A.T of Women&amp;rsquo;s Saber Fencing? Visualizing Fencing History (2003-2023) Project Context As a culminating project for an information design and visualization course at MIT, I transformed complex historical data from senior women&amp;rsquo;s saber fencing events into an accessible and engaging visual narrative. Ultimately creating an interactive data visualization showcasing the winners of senior women&amp;rsquo;s saber fencing events from the recognition of the sport as an Olympic event to the present day (2003-2023).</description>

      <description>The Process Our Vision Create a dynamic data visualization web-app merging music and textiles, transforming Spotify listening history into personalized fabric patterns.
The Challenge synThread is a dynamic data visualization web-app that seamlessly merges the realms of music and textiles. Developed as part of the Master of Design Engineering&amp;rsquo;s first-year studio course, the project was a collaborative effort among a team of three, including myself, Gail Alderson and Sophie Leamon. Our challenge was to craft an innovative data visualization concept centered around textiles, culminating in the creation of a personalized fabric design generated from a user&amp;rsquo;s Spotify listening history.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Aging in Grace&amp;rdquo; Inspired by my grandmother Annie, Carbot&amp;rsquo;s aim is to empower aging adults by facilitating medication management and fostering connections with their care team and community. While it&amp;rsquo;s a healthcare device in terms of functionality, at its core it&amp;rsquo;s about providing autonomy and connection to adults seeking to age in place.
What began as a 1-week design sprint with the brief, &amp;ldquo;Identify a need and design a robot to solve that need&amp;rdquo; ended as a personal project.</description>
